Static multilingual site structure:

- Source templates live under `templates/`.
- Published localized pages are generated into `/`, `/he/`, `/es/`, `/fr/`, and the other language-code folders.
- Use language codes for URLs, not country codes. Example: `/he/`, not `/il/`.
- Niche/use-case page content (per locale) lives in `scripts/niche-pages/<locale>.mjs`; shared niche config (slugs, images, legacy redirects) is in `scripts/niche-pages/index.mjs`.
- Rebuild all localized pages with `npm run build:locales`.
- Regenerate optimized niche images (hero/card webp + og jpg) with `npm run build:images` after replacing a source PNG in `assets/wifigate_niche_pages/`.
- Verify the generated site (SEO metadata, links, redirects, sitemap) with `node scripts/verify-site.mjs`.

## WiFiGate Invitation Redirect Contract

`templates/wifigate-link.template.html` treats the encrypted `ep` invitation
payload as opaque and forwards the complete query string to the mobile deep
link. The mobile payload may contain the `ao` user capability (`1` enabled,
`0` disabled, missing means enabled). The website must not decrypt, remove, or
rewrite that field. Legacy verbose query parameters, including `ao`, are also
preserved by the same pass-through behavior.
